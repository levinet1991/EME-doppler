# EME-doppler
Earth–Moon–Earth communication (EME), also known as moon bounce, is a radio communications technique that relies on the propagation of radio waves from an Earth-based transmitter directed via reflection from the surface of the Moon back to an Earth-based receiver.

Doppler effect at 144 MHz band is 300 Hz at moonrise or moonset. The doppler offset goes to around zero when the Moon is overhead. At other frequencies other doppler offsets will exist. At moonrise, returned signals will be shifted approximately 300 Hz higher in frequency. As the Moon traverses the sky to a point due south the Doppler effect approaches nothing. By Moonset they are shifted 300 Hz lower. Doppler effects cause many problems when tuning into and locking onto signals from the Moon.

Weak Signal Communication Software
WSJT-X, WSJT, MAP65, and WSPR are open-source programs designed for weak-signal digital communication by amateur radio.  Normal usage requires a standard SSB transceiver and a personal computer with soundcard, or the equivalent.  SDR-style hardware including the SDR-IQ, Perseus, SoftRock, and FUNcube Dongle is supported by MAP65 and WSPR. SimJT is a utility program that generates simulated signals for test purposes. All of the programs are available free of charge, licensed under the GNU General Public License.  Installation packages for WSJT-X are available for Windows, Linux, and OS X; WSJT and WSPR have Windows and Linux packages, and MAP65 and SimJT are Windows only.
